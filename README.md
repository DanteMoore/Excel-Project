# Excel-Project
Excel data that I cleaned and then created a dashboard for showing bike sales.
I wanted to answer questions such as:
-What's the average income per person?
-What's the average age of a purchaser?
-What's their commute distance?
I then went on and added slicers to filter based on marital status, region, and education level.
